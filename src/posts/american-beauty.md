# A masterpiece

American Beauty is the best film I have ever watched so far in my life.

The cinematography is excellent, and the story hits the market for me on so many points.

You need to watch this film.

## Cinematography

Here's one of the scenes tha stood out to me.

Notice how Lester and Angela walk towards eachother. I was expecting them to do the standard thing of the two actors being framed in both sides of the door.

Instead, Lester walks quicker, symbolising how he has been the one chasing Angela. The result is that they both occupy the same half of the door. It's intimate. It symbolising the sexual chemistry and the eventual act that involves the coming together of two people.

And this isn't the exception, the whole film is shot like this.

## Thoughts

After this, I feel quite knumb to other movies at the moment. Reading Reddit, and looking at other people's suggestions as to what they consider to be a “masterpiece” astonishes me. Gladiator, The Dark Knight, Interstellar, Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse, Tangled, The Killing, Hacksaw Ridge. It's all Hollywood drivel. It's just porn.

Even Shawshank Redemption, a film I have said in the past that I love, it's good, but doesn't move me, it's... generic? Chances are none of us will experience prison life, but we are all dealing and struggling through this straneg world, that values meaningless objects, that cares what job you do, that cares how many likes on social media you get. It's all bullshit.

But I'm not saying there's no value to these films. I'm not saying some aren't great. I recently watch scarface and enjoyed it. But, American Beauty came to me in a point in my life where these issues really matter to me. This existence we're living, how frivolous it all is and yet how astronomically beautiful it is. I'm sure lot of the stuff nested within this film flies over my head, and there are better people to quantify and explain why it's good movie, but all I can say is that it moved me and that's way more than I can say for all the other films I've watched in my life.
